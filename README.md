### Chat App Using MERN
- I built a chat application using Socket.io, Express.js, and Node.js. It allows multiple users to communicate in real-time. Socket.io handles the bi-directional communication, Express.js manages the server routes, and Node.js provides the runtime environment. Users can join chat rooms, send messages, and see updates instantly.
